rework
======

A career-shift in progress . . .

The intent of this github project is to be a place where I build a portfolio of open-source data analysis work.

Note that it is combination of Java, Python, R and matlab code written for a single user (me) with the intent of one-time usage.

For samples of code intended to be long-lived and maintained by a team of developers, please see these relevant GitHub projects:
